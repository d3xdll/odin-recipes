                <dd><p>I can talk about borscht for hours. It's no secret that almost every family has its own special borscht recipe. <br> 
                    Some of us just can't imagine it without beans, while others prefer to cook it without cabbage. <br>
                    All these options have a right to exist, because there is no single “correct” recipe, 
                    just hundreds of fascinating variations.</p></dd>

            <h3>Here comes step that you should follow, because of <em> the implication</em></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to <em>200C</em>. In an ovenproof dish, <br>
                    bake the pork ribs for about <em>30 minutes</em> or until a golden crust forms. <br>
                    Meanwhile, wash and roughly chop the celery root. There is no need to peel it. <br>
                    Cut up the carrots into chunks of about the same size as the celery pieces. <br>
                    Transfer the baked ribs into a large pot, add about <em>3 litres of water</em>. <br>
                    Add the celery and carrot chunks, and half an unpeeled onion. <br>
                    Bring to a boil and cook over medium heat for about <em>30 minutes.</em></li> <br>
                
                <li>Make the sauteed vegetable base - this is what makes any borscht so flavorful. <br>
                    Dice the sweet bell pepper. Finely dice the tomatoes and the other half of the onion.</li> <br>
                
                <li>Heat the butter in a frying pan and cook the vegetables until they soften. <br>
                    Add <em>200ml</em> tomato juice and about <em>2 tbsp</em> tomato paste and cook for another <em>5-7 minutes.</em> </li> <br>
                
                <li>Using a box grater, shred one of the beetroots. Add it to the sauteed vegetables
                     and keep cooking for another 3-4 minutes.</li> <br>

                <li>Using a food processor with a juicing attachment, squeeze the juice out of the other beet <br>
                    (alternatively, you can simply grate it using the fine attachment on your box grater). <br>
                    Add the beet juice or purée and the vegetables into the pot with the ribs and celery, 
                    along with the allspice and bay leaves. Salt to taste.</li> <br>

                <li>Wash and peel <em>3-4 potatoes.</em></li> <br>

                <li>Dice them roughly and add into the pot with the rib broth. 
                    Cut the head of garlic in half and add to the pot.</li> <br>

                <li>Shred the cabbage and set it aside - we will add it to the borscht almost at the very end.</li> <br>

                <li>If you like, you can add some canned white beans to the borscht at this point.</li> <br>

                <li>Add the smoked dried pears to the pot. They will enhance the borscht with their wonderful smoky flavor.</li> <br>

                <li>Once all of the ingredients have cooked through and are tender, add the shredded cabbage to the pot. <br>
                    Cook for <em>5 more minutes</em> and take the borscht off the heat. <br>
                    Let it rest for at least <em>half an hour before serving</em> with sour cream and finely chopped dill. <br>
                    Keep the borscht in the fridge and remember that it will become even more delicious overnight.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>And just like that, borsch is ready</p>
